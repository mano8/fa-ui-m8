"""Static policy tests for the init-common.sh advisory preflight contract (item 0.4).

These tests parse the shell script directly — no running Docker or scanner required.

Policy:
  init-common.sh MUST shell out to `security-tests-m8 preflight` when the CLI
  is available, but MUST NOT exit on a non-zero return code — the invocation is
  advisory only and must never block `compose up`.

Contract rules verified:
  1. The scanner is invoked (positive: line is present).
  2. The invocation uses `|| _preflight_rc=$?` to capture — not propagate — the
     exit code (non-zero is never re-raised).
  3. A `command -v` guard wraps the call (graceful fallback when not installed).
  4. The script never calls `exit 1` (or any exit with a hard-coded non-zero
     code) in the preflight block — blocking init on preflight failure is the
     specific anti-pattern this item corrects.
  5. A fallback message is emitted when the scanner is absent, directing the
     operator to install it.
